# Database-Project-Final-Report-And-SQL-Assignment

This is from my course titled "Physical Design and Implementation with DBMS‚Äù in which we studied databases and SQL. 
The class project involved working with a team to design a database from the ground up by developing E-R diagrams, the database schema, and a test plan. 
This design was then implemented using SQL within phpMyAdmin, a tool for MySQL and MariaDB. 
We also had several homework assignments involving the use of SQL. 
A report for the design, a report for the implementation, and the SQL assignment results are in this respository.
